# U.K. Road Accident Analysis

This project explores open-source UK road accident data to identify high-risk regions, time-based patterns, and contributing factors to accidents across time and geography.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI (for dashboard visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Dataset
- Source: [UK Department for Transport Open Data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data)
- Dataset Size: Approx 1 Million+ accident records from 2015–2020
- Fields: Accident severity, date/time, location coordinates, road type, weather conditions, age group involved

## 🚀 Key Analysis
- Time-series trends in accident frequency (monthly and yearly breakdown)
- Geographical analysis: Accident density by region and city
- Heatmaps showing correlations between weather, time, and accident severity
- Analysis of accidents by age group and road conditions
- Identified peak accident hours and dangerous driving conditions

## 📊 Dashboard (Power BI)
- Created an interactive dashboard displaying accident hotspots, severity trends, and risky time periods.
- Filters added for Year, Region, Weather Conditions, and Severity Levels.

## 📈 Outcome
- Visualized accident hotspots across the UK to assist in road safety policy planning
- Highlighted key risk factors contributing to accidents such as poor weather, speeding, and night-time driving
- Suggested possible interventions: better lighting in high-risk areas, public awareness campaigns for winter driving
